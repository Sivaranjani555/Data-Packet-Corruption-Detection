# Data-Packet-Corruption-Detection
In a Wireless communciation network, multiple data packets are transmitting over the air.Some data packets may drops in between and some may reaching their destination.To find corruption of the data packet we are using various methods.one of the methods is CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Code) checking algorithm.
In this code we have implemented CRC algorithm to find corruption.
